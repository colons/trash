Uhhhhhhhhhh <anime>
Someone at work was telling me about how great <anime> was and I'm like fuuuuuck offffff
Caught someone streaming episodes of <anime> on twitch and I reported them because fuck that show
To tell you the truth I wouldn't wipe my ass with <anime>
I vomited up something with a better story than <anime> tbh
The fans ruined <anime> for me, it's just not good any more
The opening music is just about the only good thing about <anime>
People said I should watch <anime> but to be honest I don't get the hype
<anime> is literally the worst thing I've ever watched and I think I'd rather die than watch it again
