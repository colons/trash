Remember <anime>? Trash.
Someone told me today that they enjoyed <anime>. They are wrong, because it's trash.
Caught someone streaming episodes of <anime>. I left immediately, because it's trash.
You know what's trash? <anime>.
I'm sorry, but <anime> is trash. If you think about it, you'll agree.
It doesn't matter how many of you nerds tell me otherwise, <anime> is trash.
<anime>. Trash.
I wouldn't wipe my ass with copies of <anime>.
You could give it away and I still wouldn't watch <anime>. 
I once vomited something with a better story than <anime>.
