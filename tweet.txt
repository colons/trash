Uhhhhhhhhhh <anime>
Someone at work was telling me about how great <anime> was and I'm like fuuuuuck offffff
Caught someone streaming episodes of <anime> on twitch and I reported them because fuck that show
To tell you the truth I wouldn't wipe my ass with <anime>
I vomited up something with a better story than <anime> tbh
The fans ruined <anime> for me, it's just not good any more
The opening music is just about the only good thing about <anime>
People said I should watch <anime> but to be honest I don't get the hype
<anime> is literally the worst thing I've ever watched and I think I'd rather die than watch it again
<anime> is trash. <anime> is trash. <anime> is ultra trash
<anime> is for children and stupid people. It's not as mature and intelligent as you think it is
<anime> is a bland, unnecessarily confusing and shallow anime with ugly character art
<anime> really is 2deep4u. That's not so much praise of it as it is an insult to the hypothetical you
The source material for <anime> may, in fact, be one of the worst things ever written by a human
<anime>'s ending was dumb and tried way too hard
<anime> was average as hell
<anime> is the worst case of missed opportunity in the history of anime. It could have been great, but it's pretty shitty instead.
I don't get the hype around <anime>. The art-style is so ugly.
<anime> was a horrible show to watch. It is not a deconstruction, it exists to make you mad.
I have no clue why anyone likes <anime> or how anyone can enjoy it
<anime> is bad. Really bad.
All of <anime> is awful. Every character is black or white and boring.
<anime> is crap. The storyline is full of plot holes and the forced drama doesnt make it any better...
<anime> sucks. All new shows suck, old shows are better and when they end anime will die.
<anime> was at best an example of Poe's Law. I sure hope it was a parody...
